Correctness

The code appears to be correctly implementing the logic of grouping anagrams in an array of strings.
It uses a dictionary to store the anagrams and their corresponding strings, and sorts the characters
in each string to form a key for the dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, it 
appends the string to the corresponding value list. Otherwise, it creates a new key-value pair in the
dictionary. The final output is a list of values from the dictionary, which contains the grouped anagrams.


However, there is a small typo in the code on line x = "".join(sorted()). It should include the string i 
that is being processed, so it should be x = "".join(sorted(i)) instead. 
Additionally, there are some minor formatting issues on lines 3, 4, 10, and 11.

Efficiency

Regarding efficiency, the code could be optimized slightly by using a hash function instead of sorting 
the characters to form the dictionary key. This would reduce the time complexity, although for small input
sizes, the difference may not be significant.

Style

In terms of style, the code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, with consistent variable naming 
and whitespace usage. However, there are some minor issues that could be improved, such as using snake_case 
instead of camelCase for the class and method names. It would also be helpful to add a docstring to the 
groupAnagrams method to explain its purpose and usage.

Documentation

Documentation is currently lacking in the code. It would be helpful to add comments to explain the logic of 
the implementation and how it solves the problem of grouping anagrams. Additionally, creating a README.md 
file that describes how to set up and run the code, and any additional information about the implementation 
and usage, would be beneficial.
